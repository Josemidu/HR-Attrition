# HR-Attrition
A full classification model, dedicated to provide meaningful insights for an efficient human resource management.
Briefly, this project was meant to understand causality of employees leaving the organization. Many insights came to light as I kept up with
the process, but in general terms we could conclude the following:

1. Satisfaction plays an important role since more satisfied employees are more likely to stay, everything else being equal.
2. In addition, employees who have recently had a child, are more likely to stay everything being equal for not so obvious reasons.
3. Moreover, employees involved in more projects happen to be more likely to stay in the company, everything else being equal.
4. Finally, 95% of the employees are likely to stay whereas 19% are likely to leave; given 82% correctly classified observations.

To conclude, this company should find a balance, between attrition and employees' score. That is, computing a score given the probability of leaving
times employees' performance, the firm would have a big picture of which employees are worth to retain and which ones not.
